# Privacy Policy

*Last updated 10/5/2021*

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. This policy describes what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data to, or share your data with any third party. 

# Part 1: Information we collect and How we handle them
The only information we collect is the user "selected text" from webpage which he/she is browsering, through relevant Google APIs. From this selected text, a list of models that the user might want to query is extracted from the selected text. 

This extracted model list will then be sent to a model database to do a information query and the result will be then returned and displayed on the user's chrome. The queried data will never be stored, shared with, or sold to any third party. 

The developer will not track these information neither, nor access them.  

# Part 2: Why we collect this information
To provide the service required by this extension, the extracted "model list" for query is the bare minium information we need. 

The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.
